Attribute VB_Name = "modDebugPrint"

'
' This is a Stand-Alone module that can be thrown into any project.
' It works in conjunction with the PersistentDebugPrint program, and that program must be running to use this module.
' The only procedure you should worry about is the DebugPrint procedure.
' Basically, it does what it says, provides a "Debug" window that is persistent across your development IDE exits and starts (even IDE crashes).
