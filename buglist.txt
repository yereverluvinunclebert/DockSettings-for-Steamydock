' Define any key to toggle hiding not just function keys - at the moment it is much more sensible to have a single key defined
'   Using this code it can be done - https://www.developerfusion.com/code/271/create-a-hot-key/
'   but this will require subclassing within steamydock. All the solutions I have found require sub-classing.
'   Within the hotkey folder under vb6 there is code that will identify keypresses (dockSettings) and will respond
'   via sub-classing (steamyDock).

'   test running with a blank tool settings file

'   test running with a blank dock settings file
