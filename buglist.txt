' fix the drag corner position on form_load

' update the help files WIP

' save the form size on setting and when saving

' resize the form on startup if a form size has been saved

' theme skin images, higher res. versions create

' frmMessage msgbox error during compilation as per steamydock

' separate common.bas and common2.bas to make it easier to compile just the one utility on its own.

' resource file for the ocx as per rocketdock
'
' Define any key to toggle hiding not just function keys - at the moment it is much more sensible to have a single key defined
'   Using this code it can be done - https://www.developerfusion.com/code/271/create-a-hot-key/
'   but this will require subclassing within steamydock. All the solutions I have found require sub-classing.
'   Within the hotkey folder under vb6 there is code that will identify keypresses (dockSettings) and will respond
'   via sub-classing (steamyDock).
'
'   test running with a blank tool settings file
'
'   test running with a blank dock settings file
'
'   add logging to a file as per FCW.
