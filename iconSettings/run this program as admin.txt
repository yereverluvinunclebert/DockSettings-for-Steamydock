This program installs my Rocketdock Enhanced Settings Utility written in VB6.
If you haven't already done so then you must run this program as administrator
or it may not install properly.

How? Right click on the setup.exe and select run as administrator. That's it.
You can safely ignore this message next time!

At the end of the installation the program should auto-start here but if it
doesn't please understand it is probably Windows 10 and Win10 is a pain in the...
bloody arse!

You may have something small to do when the installer completes. Please test the
program and if it runs then all is well. If it complains about an OCX being
required then you may need to run the registerOCX program (as admin) that is
included with the package. What it does is to register a required OCX (DLL) that
gives the program treeview and slider functionality that it requires to operate.
Only run the registerOCX program if the error occurs.

I will eventually fix these inconsistencies and find a newer and better installer
but this tool is an early release and in beta! (still in development).

Good luck and report any bugs please on deviantart.
