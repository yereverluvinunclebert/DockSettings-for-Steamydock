# DockSettings for Steamydock

DOCK SETTINGS for Steamydock, written in VB6. A WoW64 dock settings
utility for Reactos, XP, Win7, 8 and 10+.

This utility controls the settings of the dock and where the user makes 
configuration changes for the dock itself. The utility is a functional 
reproduction of the original Rocketdock dock settings screen with some 
enhancements. The look and feel of the GUI is limited to emulating and 
enhancing what Rocketdock provided. The idea is that this will make the utility 
quite familiar to Rocketdock users. It operates with Steamydock, my open source 
replacement for Rocketdock.

NOTE: The dock settings tool is Beta-grade software, under development, not yet 
ready to use on a production system - use at your own risk.

NOTE: This tool and the build instructions are being overhauled, do not expect 
it to load without flaws until this message is removed.

BUILD: The program runs without any additional Microsoft plugins.

Built using: VB6, MZ-TOOLS 3.0, VBAdvance, CodeHelp Core IDE Extender
Framework 2.2 & Rubberduck 2.4.1

Tested on :

	ReactOS 0.4.14 32bit on virtualBox  
	Windows 7 Professional 32bit on Intel  
	Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit on Intel  
	Windows 7 Professional 64bit on Intel  
	Windows XP SP3 32bit on Intel  
	Windows 10 Home 64bit on Intel  
	Windows 10 Home 64bit on AMD  
	Windows 11 64bit on Intel

Dependencies:

o A windows-alike o/s such as Windows XP, 7-11 or ReactOS.

o Microsoft VB6 IDE installed with its runtime components. The program runs 
without any additional Microsoft OCX components, just the basic controls that 
ship with VB6.

o Requires the SteamyDock program source code to be downloaded and available in 
an adjacent folder as some of the BAS modules are common and shared.

Example folder structure:
	
	E:\VB6\steamydock   ! https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/SteamyDock
	E:\VB6\docksettings ! this repo.
	E:\VB6\rocketdock   ! from https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/rocketdock

o Krool's replacement for the Microsoft Windows Common Controls found in
mscomctl.ocx (slider) are replicated by the addition of one
dedicated OCX file that are shipped with this package.

During development these should be copied to C:\windows\syswow64 and should be registered.

- CCRSlider.ocx

Register these using regsvr32, ie. in a CMD window with administrator privileges.
	
	c:                          ! set device to boot drive with Windows
	cd \windows\syswow64s	    ! change default folder to syswow64
	regsvr32 CCRImageList.ocx	! register the ocx


This will allow the custom controls to be accessible to the VB6 IDE
at design time and the sliders will function as intended (if this ocx is
not registered correctly then the relevant controls will be replaced by picture boxes).

No need to do the above at runtime. At runtime these OCX will reside in the program folder. The program reference to this OCX is contained within the supplied resource file, dockSettings.RES. The reference to these 
files is compiled into the binary. As long as the OCX is in the same folder as the binary
the program will run without the need to register the OCX manually.

o In the VB6 IDE - project - references - browse - select the OLEEXP.tlb

I have really tried to maintain the credits as the project has progressed. If I
have made a mistake and left someone out then do forgive me. I will make amends
if anyone points out my mistake in leaving someone out.

MicroSoft in the 90s - MS built good, lean and useful tools in the late 90s and
early 2000s. Thanks for VB6.
